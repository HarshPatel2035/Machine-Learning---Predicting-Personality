# Machine Learning - Predicting Personality

A machine learning project focused on predicting personality traits, specifically classifying individuals as either extroverts or introverts based on various behavioral and psychological indicators.

## 📋 Project Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that implements machine learning algorithms to predict personality types. The project demonstrates the application of various ML techniques for personality classification, which can be useful in psychology research, human resources, and behavioral analysis.

## 🎯 Objective

The main goal of this project is to:
- Build a machine learning model to classify personality types (Extrovert vs Introvert)
- Analyze behavioral patterns and psychological indicators
- Demonstrate the practical application of ML in personality psychology
- Provide insights into personality prediction using data-driven approaches
